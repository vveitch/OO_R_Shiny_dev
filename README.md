# OO_R_Shiny_dev
This is material produced for an introductory statistics course developed as part of the Ontario Online projected. The full course is available at http://sta220.utstat.utoronto.ca/. This repo consists of learning activities and RShiny applications designed for teaching various introductory statistics topics.

Running these appications locally will require RShiny, http://shiny.rstudio.com/. Once the software is installed the applications can be launched through RStudio (just open them and a "play" button will appear). See the RShiny documentation in case there's any confusion.

Some of the applications can (as of 28-12-2015) be seen in production at:
